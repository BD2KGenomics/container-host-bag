## About container-host-bag

This project consists of a set of Ansible playbooks that allow you to deploy a host running Docker and the [Consonance](https://github.com/Consonance/consonance) worker daemon.  This host then is capable of running jobs scheduled out to Consonance, a cloud orchestration system capable of managing large fleets of worker hosts on clouds.  These jobs are any tools or workflows available at [Dockstore](https://dockstore.org).  See the [Consonance](https://github.com/Consonance/consonance) project page for more information.
